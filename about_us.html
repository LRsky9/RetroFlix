                                <p>At RetroFlix, we are passionate about the golden age of movies, particularly the 1980-1990s, and we want to explore this market space. Our business model is built on the belief that there is a demand for classic movies that aren't currently available on other streaming platforms. We aim to offer our customers access to these movies in a way that is both convenient and affordable.</p>
                                <p>Our mission is to provide our customers with access to entertainment from the back catalogue which will not detract from other areas of the business. We value our customers and are committed to providing them with the best possible service. We strive to maintain the highest standards of quality and integrity in all aspects of our business. We believe that by doing so, we can earn the trust and loyalty of our customers.</p>
